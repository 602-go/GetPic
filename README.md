## Sections

### 1. Title
**Status:** Required.

**Requirements:**
- Title must match repository, folder and package manager names - or it may have another, relevant title with the repository, folder, and package manager title next to it in italics and in parentheses. For instance:

  ```markdown
  # Standard Readme Style _(standard-readme)_
  ```

  If any of the folder, repository, or package manager names do not match, there must be a note in the [Long Description](#long-description) explaining why.

**Suggestions:**
- Should be self-evident.

### 2. Banner
**Status:** Optional.

**Requirements:**
- Must not have its own title.
- Must link to local image in current repository.
- Must appear directly after the title.

### 3. Short Description
**Status:** Required.

**Requirements:**
- Must not have its own title.
- Must be less than 120 characters.
- Must not start with `> `
- Must be on its own line.
- Must match the description in the packager manager's `description` field.
- Must match GitHub's description (if on GitHub).

**Suggestions:**
- Use [gh-description](https://github.com/RichardLitt/gh-description) to set and get GitHub description.
- Use `npm show . description` to show the description from a local [npm](https://npmjs.com) package.

#### Example


### 4. Table of Contents
**Status:** Required; optional for READMEs shorter than 100 lines.

**Requirements:**
- Must link to all Markdown sections in the file.
- Must start with the next section; do not include the title or Table of Contents headings.
- Must be at least one-depth: must capture all `##` headings.

**Suggestions:**
- May capture third and fourth depth headings. If it is a long ToC, these are optional. 

  
### 5. Install
**Status:** Required by default, optional for [documentation repositories](#definitions).

**Requirements:**
- Code block illustrating how to install.

**Subsections:**
- `Dependencies`. Required if there are unusual dependencies or dependencies that must be manually installed.

**Suggestions:**
- Link to prerequisite sites for programming language: [npmjs](https://npmjs.com), [godocs](https://godoc.org), etc.
- Include any system-specific information needed for installation.
- An `Updating` section would be useful for most packages, if there are multiple versions which the user may interface with.

#### ChatBot

#### Web

### 6. API
**Status:** Optional.

**Requirements:**
- Describe exported functions and objects.

**Suggestions:**
- Describe signatures, return types, callbacks, and events.
- Cover types covered where not obvious.
- Describe caveats.
- If using an external API generator (like go-doc, js-doc, or so on), point to an external `API.md` file. This can be the only item in the section, if present.

### 7. Maintainer(s)
**Status**: Optional.

**Requirements:**
- Must be called `Maintainer` or `Maintainers`.
- List maintainer(s) for a repository, along with one way of contacting them (e.g. GitHub link or email).

**Suggestions:**
- This should be a small list of people in charge of the repo. This should not be everyone with access rights, such as an entire organization, but the people who should be pinged and who are in charge of the direction and maintenance of the repository.
- Listing past maintainers is good for attribution, and kind.

### 8. Thanks
**Status**: Optional.

**Requirements:**
- Must be called `Thanks`, `Credits` or `Acknowledgements`.

**Suggestions:**
- State anyone or anything that significantly helped with the development of your project.
- State public contact hyper-links if applicable.

### 9. Contributing
**Status**: Required.

**Requirements:**
- State where users can ask questions.
- State whether PRs are accepted.
- List any requirements for contributing; for instance, having a sign-off on commits.

**Suggestions:**
- Link to a CONTRIBUTING file -- if there is one.
- Be as friendly as possible.
- Link to the GitHub issues.
- Link to a Code of Conduct. A CoC is often in the Contributing section or document, or set elsewhere for an entire organization, so it may not be necessary to include the entire file in each repository. However, it is highly recommended to always link to the code, wherever it lives.
- A subsection for listing contributors is also welcome here.
